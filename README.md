# tools-notes
This is the repo where I keep my notes for the tools I use the most.

# Tools
I use the following tools for my daily work and for my out-of-work work. There
is a big list of other things I use, some of them are too complicated to be
included in this list, such as vim, but I have this [repo](https://github.com/jutkko/vim-notes)
for vim notes; some are too simple like flycut and you can master it within a
minute. Arguably git will also be very complicated, but I cannot be bothered to
create a separate repo for that to maintain. **Note**: I have only included the
links to the tools that are younger than me. Search on google for the rest of
them :).
